Using open-source sbvmidi-driver by adanselm as the basis to learn dealing with Windows drivers.

First development has been modifications for Visual Studio 2017.

Driver is able to install, but fails due to signing issues.  Therefore, I am applying for an open-source certificate to sign
the .sys file rather than dual-boot into test sign mode.

Later experiments will be to add support for changing the driver name - similar to loopMIDI.
